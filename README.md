# Clicky-Game (React.js)

### About

* `CLICKY-GAME` is a memory game built with `React.js` The goal of the game is simple, using your mouse, `CLICK` each of the twelve `Game of Thrones` character cards in whatever order you chose - the order does not matter, only that you do not click the same card twice!  

* `EACH` click triggers the board of cards to reshuffle, thus, you cannot simply click the cards in the order in which they appear on screen.

* `COUNTERS` displayed to the top right and left of the board keep track of your current as well as top score.
